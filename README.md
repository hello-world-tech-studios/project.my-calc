# My Calc

## Objective
Create a functioning calculator out of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. Your calculator should contain all of the standard functionality (add, subtract, divide, multiply, clear, equals). You only need to handle mouse clicks, but for extra credit you could including keyboard input to your calculator as well.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

\* Note: Bootstrap is included if you would like to use it. However, it is possible to complete this assignment using pure CSS.

## The Code
```
my-book/
|
├── index.html    - write all of your html here
|
├── styles.css    - write all of your css here
|
├── script.js     - write all of your javascript here
|
├── README.md     - the all-knowing README
|
└── .gitignore    - just ignore this .gitignore file

```
## To-Do
- Create a calculator UI with HTML and CSS. It must contain all of the numbers, functionality, and a display for the current value.
- Set up click handlers for each clickable component that you created.
- Take some time to think about the actual mechanism that you will need to create for your calculator. What information will you need to store? How do each of the functionality buttons affect the display? Do you need to remember any previous input values?
- Once you have thought out a mechanism for your calculator, implement it.
